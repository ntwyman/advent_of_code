[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

Some of us at [Truss](https://truss.works/team) are doing the Advent of Code puzzles. We share...

## Running solutions

To run the solution for a given day and part

``` shell
> mix run aoc.exs -d <day> -p <1 | 2>
```

e.g.

``` shell
> mix run aoc.exs -d 3 -p 2
```

runs the solution for day3 part 2.

## Running tests

To run all tests

``` shell
> mix test
```

or to run a particular day's tests, e.g.

``` shell
> mix test test/day1_test.exs
```
