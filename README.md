# advent_of_code

Repository for my attempt at the annual Advent of Code (<https://adventofcode.com>)

I tend to try a "new" language each year. Its a good excuse to try something new and the advent of code excercises are usually a good way to get fairly deep into a language in a little while.

* 2019 - Elixir
* 2020 - F# (on a bit of a functional kick)
* 2021 - Julia
* 2022 - Rust
